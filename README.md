Problem Statement or what we are trying to solve ?
=============



## Enterprises are increasingly relying on Cloud/Enterprise/Application/Security/Networking Architects to build, validate, deploy and manage their IT infrastructure and services in Cloud.

However, the process of implementing cloud architecture can be complex and time-consuming, particularly when it comes to preparing deployment templates for infrastructure, networking, PaaS Services and tagging for project teams.

In most cases, organizations struggle to meet project timelines due to delays in the implementation of Cloud architecture, which can result in increased costs, decreased productivity, and missed business opportunities.

Therefore, there is a need to identify and address the factors that contribute to delays in implementing cloud architecture, particularly in relation to the preparation of deployment templates for infra with networking and PaaS services with tagging along with CAF framework, Well Architecture framework which covers both governance and security baselines.

By doing so, organizations can streamline the implementation process and ensure that they are able to deploy and manage their Cloud IT infrastructure and services in a timely and efficient manner with less efforts and more productivity.

## Idea : A SaaS platform where Architects/Application owners will upload the futuristic reference cloud (azure/aws/gcp/oracle/multi-cloud/penta-cloud) to generate Terraform/ARM/CloudFormation code templates from Architecture diagram (PNG/JPEG/PDF) which are ready to deploy in few minutes.

## Platform uses concept of converting image to code Transforming a graphical user interface screenshot created by a Architect into computercode is a typical task but not impossible. 

## So, after doing research and reading neural compute &amp; networking algorithms. I see a possibility to train a model with sample datasets which consists of 
## Azure/AWS/GCP/oracle Stencils where model will Encode/decode and generate terraform/arm/cloud formation code using libraries.

| Model Dataset 1.0            | Dataset Annotation  | Stenciles Included |
| :------------------          |:---------------:    | -----:|
| Supported Feature 1          | Azure Stencils      | 50 |
| Supported Feature 2          | AWS Stencils        | 50 |
| Supported Feature 3          | GCP Stencils        | 50 |

### Identified Flow Based on Research and Documentation

## Step1 : Use Tensorflow code pre-trained object detection models that can be fine tuned to recognize Azure, AWS & GCP Services from Stencils like SVG files.
## Step2 : Send the output using Tensorflow OD Api or Microsoft Azure Custom Vision Service.
## Step3 : Python scripts encodes the image to base64 string format, which can used as input for further processing, such as generating terraform code to deploy the cloud service
