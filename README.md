Problem Statement or what we are trying to solve ?
=============
Problem Statement or what we are trying to solve or acheive

Enterprises are increasingly relying on Cloud/Enterprise/Application/Security/Networking
Architects to build, validate, deploy and manage their IT infrastructure and services in
Cloud.

However, the process of implementing cloud architecture can be complex and time-
consuming, particularly when it comes to preparing deployment templates for infrastructure,
networking, PaaS Services and tagging for project teams.

In most cases, organizations struggle to meet project timelines due to delays in the
implementation of Cloud architecture, which can result in increased costs, decreased
productivity, and missed business opportunities.

Therefore, there is a need to identify and address the factors that contribute to delays in
implementing cloud architecture, particularly in relation to the preparation of deployment
templates for infra with networking and PaaS services with tagging along with CAF
framework, Well Architecture framework which covers both governance and security
baselines.

By doing so, organizations can streamline the implementation process and ensure that they
are able to deploy and manage their Cloud IT infrastructure and services in a timely and
efficient manner with less efforts and more productivity.

Idea : A SaaS platform where Architects/Application owners will upload the futuristic
reference cloud (azure/aws/gcp/oracle/multi-cloud/penta-cloud) to generate
Terraform/ARM/CloudFormation code templates from Architecture diagram
(PNG/JPEG/PDF) which are ready to deploy in few minutes.

Platform uses concept of converting image to code
Transforming a graphical user interface screenshot created by a designer into computer
code is a typical task but not impossible. 

So, after doing research and reading neural
compute &amp; networking algorithms. I see a possibility to train a model with sample datasets
which consists of Azure/AWS/GCP/oracle Stencils where model will Encode/decode and
generate terraform/arm/cloud formation code using libraries.
